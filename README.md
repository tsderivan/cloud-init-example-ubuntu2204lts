# cloud-init-example-ubuntu2204lts

The intent of this project is to aid creation of VirtualBox virtual machines
without cloning the instance' machine_id, ssh-keys, etc.
(A sysprep-like tool for Ubuntu)

Yes, I know there are many tools out there.
I have used ubuntu for 1 week now....gotta start somewhere.
I suck at documentation. I have dyslexia. Fuck me, right?

# I will put some useful stuff in readme when time permits.
Time to feed the goats..

# The passwords and keys are just an example and should never be used in a production environment.

Prerequisites are:
VirtualBox
cloud-utils


create ISO or IMG using cloud-localds command, part of cloud-utils package.
create password hashes using mkpasswd command, part of the whois package.
