# cloud-init-example-ubuntu2204lts

The intent of this project is to aid creation of VirtualBox virtual machines
without cloning the instance' machine_id, ssh-keys, etc.


# I will put some useful stuff in readme when time permits.
Time to feed the goats..

# The passwords and keys are just an example and should never be used in a production environment.

# Prerequisites are:
ubuntu cloud image https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/
VirtualBox
cloud-utils
whois

create ISO or IMG using cloud-localds command, part of cloud-utils package.
create password hashes using mkpasswd command, part of the whois package.



# todo:
This has quickly become a pain in the ass. It is okay for a generic install of ubuntu though.
I'll be looking into Multipass and Vagrant and packer.
